<h1>Type of NFC devices</h1>

<h2>Passive NFC</h2>
Passive <code>NFC</code> 
Devices include tags, and other small transmitters, that can send information to other NFC devices without the need for a power source of their own. However, they don’t really process any information sent from other sources, and can’t connect to other passive components. These often take the form of interactive signs on walls or advertisements.<br><br>
Mostly Passive NFC devices will be without batteries, thus the cost of such devices will be very low.
