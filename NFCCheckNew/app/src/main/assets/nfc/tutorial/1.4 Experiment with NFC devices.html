<h1>Experiments with NFC devices </h1>

Just like Bluetooth and WiFi, and all manner of other wireless signals, NFC works on the principle of sending information over radio waves.  Near Field Communication is another standard for wireless data transitions, meaning that there are specifications which devices have to adhere to in order to communicate with each other properly. The technology used in NFC is based on older RFID (Radio-frequency identification) ideas, which uses electromagnetic induction in order to transmit information.<br><br>

Two things you need before starting NFC experiments (considering that you already have NFC enabled phone)
<ul>
    <li><b><font color="#00796B">NFC Tags</font></b><br></li>
    You need NFC tags which you can put at places like inside car, stick at bag or laptop, at your home entrance. NFC tags are ~1 dollar per tag. In India you cab consider buying LINQ NFC tags which are reliable. <a href=

    <li><b><font color="#00796B">Trigger App</font></b><br></li>
    <img src="../imgs/ic_launcher.png" width="50px" alt="Hello">
    You need an App to read and writing to NFC tag. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jwsoft.nfcactionlauncher"> Trigger app </a> provides many functionality for free which are sufficient for the beginners. And as you go on, you can find many other free apps for reading/writing to NFC tag.
</ul>
    
Here are the five uses for NFC on your smartphones.
<ul>
    <li><b><font color="#00796B">Turning on Bluetooth, turn off WIFI when you enter in car</font></b><br></li>
    If you have a bluetooth compatible car radio or headset in your car, then an NFC tag will certainly make your life easier. Let it turn on your bluetooth so your smartphone automatically connects to your radio or headset and let it play your favorite playlist. Do you use your phone’s GPS to navigate? Use a tag to turn on Google Maps and disable turning of the screen while charging. You can use Trigger app for reading and writing into NFC tags.

    <li><b><font color="#00796B">Get Yourself Out of Bed</font></b><br></li>
    If you’re anything like me, getting yourself out of bed in the morning is a huge challenge. Although I use one of the best Android sleep trackers — the Sleep As Android app — I still find it tough to avoid snoozing the alarm and continue in my sleep.<br><br>
    Luckily, Sleep As Android has a system for helping you with that called “Captchas“. These are widely used on the Internet to verify that you are human, but within the app they are used to check if you are really awake.
    <br><br>
    <li><b><font color="#00796B">Launch a Website URL</font></b><br></li>
    There might be times when you want to direct someone to a specific website. This can be a bit tricky, especially if it’s not a simple website address. Instead of having them type out a long random URL, you can write the URL to an NFC tag. When tapped, it loads the user’s mobile browser and directs them straight to the site you wanted.
    <br><br>
    <li><b><font color="#00796B">Get Into <code>Driving Mode</code></font></b><br></li>
    A smartphone can be a great companion when going driving as it allows you to juggle navigation, music, and hands-free calls. But it can sometimes be a bit of a hassle to set each service up when you first get into the car.

    Instead of manually setting them up each time you get in the car, you can use Trigger to set up multiple stacked actions on an NFC tag. Stacked actions allow you to program multiple actions to happen simultaneously when you tap the tag.
    <br><br>
    <li><b><font color="#00796B">Boot Up Your Computer</font></b><br></li>
    There’s nothing worse than coming home from a long day at work, throwing down your bag, getting changed, and then when you finally sit down at your computer… having to wait for it to boot.

    Luckily, Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Captainmathmo">Captainmathmo</a> came up with a great way to wake your computer up when you get in the door by simply tapping an NFC tag so that it’s ready to go as soon as you are.

    You do need to have a computer capable of receiving Wake-On-LAN requests, as well as apps to set up the WLAN, the automation app Tasker, and Trigger to write the NFC tag. If you fancy a project to you should check the Reddit post out for a full setup guide.
